The python code in structure-cio-survey scrapes survey metadata from an XML-Export from limesurvey and stores results in an sqlite table.
The code contains still hard coded file names and is created for scraping for a specific limesurvey project, yet it is still generic because this schema applies to all limesurvey questionairs as far as I know.
